Web development is an exciting field that combines creativity with technical skills. Whether you're looking to build your own website or start a career in tech, this guide will help you get started on the right path.

## What is Web Development?

Web development involves creating websites and web applications that run on the internet. It encompasses everything from simple static pages to complex interactive applications.

## The Three Pillars of Web Development

### 1. HTML (Structure)
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the basic structure of web pages. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to Web Development!</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### 2. CSS (Styling)
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) handles the visual presentation of your HTML elements.

```css
h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 2rem;
}

p {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    line-height: 1.6;
}
```

### 3. JavaScript (Behavior)
JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to your websites.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    console.log('Welcome to JavaScript!');
});
```

## Getting Started
